        <h1>Privacy Policy for 3 Sides Planner</h1>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 11, 2025</p>

        <p>
            My name is <strong>Crystal Roberts</strong> (GlowCode Studio). I created <em>3 Sides Planner</em> to help
            people living with bipolar better understand and track their wellness in one place. While bipolar is often
            described as “highs and lows,” I believe there is a third, essential side: <strong>stability</strong>. We
            all experience a range of emotions; we’re not always a “roller coaster.” This app supports balance,
            reflection, and awareness across highs, lows, and stable moments.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
            This policy explains how 3 Sides Planner handles information within the mobile/web app and on our website
            hosted at
            <a href="https://cpriss1979.github.io/3-sides-planner.io/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://cpriss1979.github.io/3-sides-planner.io/</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            3 Sides Planner does not collect your name, physical address, or precise location. To use certain features,
            you may create an account:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Login data (via Firebase Authentication):</strong> email and password (or Google sign-in) are
                required to access protected features such as <em>Toolkit</em> (feel-good tools, journal entries),
                <em>Wellness</em> (wellness plan, letter to future self, support people), <em>Pet</em>, and
                <em>Themes</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>No login required:</strong> the Home page (<code>index.html</code>) and <em>Important
                    Numbers</em> (<code>important-numbers.html</code>) are accessible without sign-in. Emergency/support
                numbers shown are for your convenience and are not tracked by us.</li>
            <li><strong>User content:</strong> journal entries, mood/side selections (highs, lows, stability), toolkit
                items, wellness plan details, pet progress, and theme selections. These may be stored locally on your
                device and, if you sign in, in your personal cloud data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
        <p>
            Information you add is used only to provide core functionality: tracking highs/lows/stability, journaling,
            customizing themes, and supporting your wellness routines. We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share your
            data with third parties for advertising or marketing.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local storage (on your device):</strong> for quick access and offline use (e.g.,
                localStorage/IndexedDB). You control this data on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud storage (Firebase Cloud Firestore):</strong> if you sign in, your account-linked content
                may be stored in Firestore under your unique user ID. Access is restricted to your account credentials.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no method of storage or transmission is 100%
            secure.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> used for account sign-in and identity. See <a
                    href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy
                    &amp; Security</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Firestore:</strong> used to store your account-specific data (e.g., journals,
                toolkit items, wellness plan, pet progress, themes) when you are signed in. See the same Firebase policy
                link above.</li>
            <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> hosts our website and this policy at <a
                    href="https://cpriss1979.github.io/3-sides-planner.io/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">cpriss1979.github.io/3-sides-planner.io</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Choices & Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local data:</strong> you can clear local data from the app’s settings (e.g., a “Reset Local
                Data” option) or via your browser/app storage settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Account deletion (in-app):</strong> you can permanently delete your account and associated cloud
                data from the app’s <em>Delete Account</em> option. This removes your Firebase Authentication account
                and your Firestore documents tied to your user ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual requests:</strong> you may email us to request account/data deletion if you’re unable to
                access the in-app option.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            3 Sides Planner is intended for users aged <strong>18 and over</strong>. We do not knowingly collect
            information from children. If you believe a minor has provided data, please contact us so we can delete it.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            Local data remains on your device until you clear it. Cloud data in Firestore remains associated with your
            account until you use the in-app deletion feature or request deletion via email.
        </p>

        <h2>International Users</h2>
        <p>
            Firebase may process and store data on servers located in the United States or other countries. By using the
            app, you consent to any such transfer, processing, and storage.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this policy from time to time to reflect app improvements, changes in third-party services, or
            legal requirements. We will update the effective date above when changes are made.
        </p>
